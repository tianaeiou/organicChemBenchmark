  "question": "When an alkane with different types of $Câ€“H$ bonds, such as propane, reacts with an equimolar mixture of $Br_2$ and $Cl_2$, the selectivity in the formation of the brominated products is much worse than that observed when reaction is carried out with $Br_2$ alone. (In fact, it is very similar to the selectivity for chlorination.) Explain.",

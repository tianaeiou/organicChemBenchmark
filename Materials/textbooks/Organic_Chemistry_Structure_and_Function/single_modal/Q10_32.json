  "question": "The $^1H$ NMR spectrum of $CH_3COCH_2C(CH_3)_3$, 4,4-dimethyl-2-pentanone, taken at 300 MHz, shows signals at the following positions: 307, 617, and 683 Hz downfield from tetramethylsilane. **(a)** What are the chemical shifts ($\\delta$\u200B) of these signals? **(b)** What would their positions be in hertz, relative to tetramethylsilane, if the spectrum were recorded at 90 MHz? At 500 MHz? **(c)** Assign each signal to a set of hydrogens in the molecule.",

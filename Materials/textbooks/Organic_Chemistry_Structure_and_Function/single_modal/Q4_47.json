  "question": "If cyclobutane were flat, it would have exactly $90^o$ C–C–C bond angles and could conceivably use pure $p$ orbitals in its C–C bonds. What would be a possible hybridization for the carbon atoms of the molecule that would allow all the C–H bonds to be equivalent? Exactly where would the hydrogens on each carbon be located? What are the real structural features of the cyclobutane molecule that contradict this hypothesis?",

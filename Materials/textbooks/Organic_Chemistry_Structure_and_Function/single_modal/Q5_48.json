  "question": "Natural epinephrine, $[\\alpha]_D^{25^oC}=-50$, is used medicinally. Its enantiomer is medically worthless and is, in fact, toxic. You, a pharmacist, are given a solution said to contain 1 g of epinephrine in 20 mL of liquid, but the optical purity is not specified. You place it in a polarimeter (10-cm tube) and get a reading of $-2.5^o$. What is the optical purity of the sample? Is it safe to use medicinally?",

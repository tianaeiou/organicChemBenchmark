  "question": "The isolation of a novel form of molecular carbon, $C_{60}$, was reported in 1990. The substance has the shape of a soccer ball of carbon atoms and possesses the nickname “buckyball” (you don’t want to know the IUPAC name). Hydrogenation produces a hydrocarbon with the molecular formula $C_{60}H_{36}$. What is the degree of unsaturation in  $C_{60}$? In  $C_{60}H_{36}$? Does the hydrogenation result place limits on the numbers of $\\pi$ bonds and rings in “buckyball”? ",

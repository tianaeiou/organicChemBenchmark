  "question": "At room temperature, 1,2-dibromoethane exists as an equilibrium mixture in which 89% of the molecules are in an anti conformation and 11% are gauche. The comparable ratio for butane under the same circumstances is 72% anti and 28% gauche. Suggest an explanation for the dif- ference, bearing in mind that $Br$ is sterically smaller than $CH_3$. (Hint: Consider the polarity of a $Câ€“Br$ bond and consequent electrostatic effects.)",

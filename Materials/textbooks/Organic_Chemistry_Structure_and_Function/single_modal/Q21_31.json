  "question": "Use the following NMR- and mass-spectral data to identify the structures of two unknown compounds, A and B.\nA: $\\ce{^1 H}$ NMR: $\\delta = 0.92$  (t, $J = 6 Hz$, 3 H), 1.32 (broad s, 12 H), 2.28 (broad s, 2 H), and 2.69 (t, $J = 7 Hz$, 2 H) ppm. Mass spectrum $m/z$ (relative intensity) = 129(0.6) and 30(100).\nB: $\\ce{^1 H}$ NMR: $\\delta = 1.00$ (s, 9 H), 1.17 (s, 6 H), 1.28 (s, 2 H), and 1.42 (s, 2 H) ppm. Mass spectrum $m/z$ (relative intensity) = 129(0.05), 114(3), 72(4), and 58(100).",

  "question": "In nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions that proceed by the additionâ€“elimination mechanism, fluorine is the most easily replaced halogen in spite of the fact that $\\ce{F^-}$ is by far the worst leaving group among halide ions. For example, 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene reacts much more rapidly with amines than does the corresponding chloro compound. Suggest an explanation. (Hint: Consider the effect of the identity of the halogen on the rate-determining step.)",

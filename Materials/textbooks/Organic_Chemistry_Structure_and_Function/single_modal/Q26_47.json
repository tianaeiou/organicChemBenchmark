  "question": "Of the 153 amino acids in myoglobin, 78 contain polar side chains (i.e., Arg, Asn, Asp, Gln, Glu, His, Lys, Ser, Thr, Trp, and Tyr). When myoglobin adopts its natural folded conformation, 76 of these 78 polar side chains (all but those of two histidines) project outward from its surface. Meanwhile, in addition to the two histidines, the interior of myoglobin contains only Gly, Val, Leu, Ala, Ile, Phe, Pro, and Met. Explain.",

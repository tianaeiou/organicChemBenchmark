    "The addition of hydrogen halides to double or triple carbon-carbon bonds can result in more than 1 product, as illustrated in Reactions 1 and 2. A chemist postulated that the formation of Products A and C involves a carbocation inter-mediate, whereas Products B and D result from a competing radical-chain addition.\n It was discovered that the results of these additions were strongly affected by the reaction conditions. For example, when Reactions 1 and 2 were carried out in the presence of silica gel ( $SiO_2 $ ) or alumina ( $Al_2O_3$ ) surfaces, the yields and product distributions were dramatically altered. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the effects of the reaction conditions on the results of Reactions 1 and 2."

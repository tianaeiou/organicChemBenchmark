  "question": "The *nitroso* group,$\\ce{-NO}$, as a substituent on a benzene ring acts as an ortho, para-directing group but is deactivating. Use the Lewis structure of the nitroso group and its inductive and resonance interactions with the benzene ring to explain this finding. (**Hint:** Consider possible similarities to another type of substituent that is ortho, paraâ€“directing but deactivating.)",

  "question": "Secreted by the pituitary gland, corticotropin is a hormone that stimulates the adrenal cortex. Determine its primary structure from the following information. (i) Hydrolysis by chymotrypsin produces six peptides: Arg-Trp, Ser-Tyr, Pro-Leu-Glu-Phe, Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe, Pro-Asp-Ala- Gly-Glu-Asp-Gln-Ser-Ala-Glu-Ala-Phe, and Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-Gly-Lys-Lys-Arg-Arg-Pro-Val- Lys-Val-Tyr. (ii) Hydrolysis by trypsin produces free lysine, free arginine, and the following five peptides: Trp-Gly-Lys, Pro-Val-Lys, Pro-Val-Gly-Lys, Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg, and Val-Tyr-Pro-Asp-Ala-Gly-Glu-Asp-Gln-Ser-Ala-Glu-Ala-Phe-Pro-Leu-Glu-Phe.",
